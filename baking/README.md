# Baking Multi-class Classification
Another hobby of mine is baking. Though most of the time I try to plan ahead for buying ingredients when I'm planning to bake, there are times I look to my cabinets and decide what to make based off of what I already have in stock. Many desserts have the same core ingredients, (flour, sugar, eggs, butter), but the ratios are what really distinguish the type of dessert. This premise sparked the idea to classify desserts based off of their ingredients and thus came along this project!

In this project, we
- employ NLP methods like regular expression matching for data pre-processing and feature extraction
- standardize our measurements to produce more accurate ratios and cleaner training data
- implement several scikit-learn classifiers and compare validation accuracy to determine the best model
- apply hyperparameter tuning to improve our model results

And of course we can't leave without dropping some of my favorite recipes (shout out to Sally, she never steers me wrong)!

I'll be honest this was box mix lol, but I did make the frosting from scratch! https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/strawberry-frosting/
