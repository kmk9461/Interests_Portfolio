# Ski Resort Recommender
One of my go-to winter pastimes is skiing. Having learned at a young age, I've been to resorts across the US and beyond and am always looking for a fun new mountain to explore! Thus comes the inspiration for this ski resort recommender. Thanks to a Kaggle dataset compiled of user-resort ratings from OnTheSnow.com, we're able to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering. We also map out the results, which helps us assess whether the recommended resorts are easily accessible to us and whether the weather is currently giving us good ski conditions. 

In this project, we
- build a recommendation system for skiiers based off of an initial dataset of 18,261 ratings
- utilize the implicit package to build alternating least squares and nearest neighbor models
- display top resort recommendations on a US map using lat/longs pulled from the Nominatim geolocater
- pull temperature and weather patterns from the openweathermap API

And before you go! Check out some of my favorite views from the mountains:
