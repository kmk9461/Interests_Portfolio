## crochet
This project is dedicated to crochet because it is one of my most favorite hobbies. I learned to knit when I was young, but started crocheting heavily at the start of COVID. I love making amigurumi the most, but enjoy making sweaters, scarfs, hats and blankets as well. The inspiration for this project was the confusion I've witnessed in real life between what crochet and knitting products look like. This can be challenging for many people to detect, so here we see how the computer can do!

In this project, we
- build a CNN classifier of crochet vs. knitting images
- utilize pytorch to build a neural network composed of convolutional, pooling, ReLU, normalization and fully connected layers
- collect a pool of 1,400 images using the BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages
- clean our images and perform data augmentations/transformations
- achieve a test accuracy of 70% 

And while we're here! Below are some of the creations I've made:
